# CSCI-3308-Final-Project
Repository for group final project in CSCI 3308 that centers on making a fitness app.

You can access all head pages from all other pages

From the home page, users are prompted to access the **Signup**, **Registration**, **Calendar**, and **Milestones** pages.

The home page also features a workout logging menu that lets you categorize your workout, search movements, and save the result to your account. Logged workouts populate the calendar and milestones pages.

From **Signup**, you are prompted to access **Registration** and vice versa. "Already have an account? -> signup" and "Need to sign up? -> registration"

In **Milestones**, the user can view their progress across various trees: calisthenics, cardio, weightlifting, and fitness metrics. These pages pull data from each user's workout logs in the database.

In **Calendar**, there is a calendar populated with user workout data pulled from the database.
Under **Signup/Registration**, the user is prompted to log in to their account or create a new one.
